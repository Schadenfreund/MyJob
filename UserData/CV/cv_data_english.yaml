  profile_summary: |
    Crisp, strategic and well-crafted storytelling has shaped my work for over 20 years across games, esports and media.
    Most recently, I worked as Senior PR & Communications Manager at ESL FACEIT Group, after several years as a games
    and esports journalist (including Germany's leading media outlets WDR, 1LIVE and Deutschlandfunk) and as a TV host
    for an esports show on sportschau.de. A gamer by passion and tech-savvy by nature, I'm ready for the next challenge.
