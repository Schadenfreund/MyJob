      I started my career in journalism and have spent over 20 years working at the intersection of media,
      technology and games. I currently work as Senior PR & Communications Manager at ESL FACEIT Group.

    - |
      In my current role, I lead and develop international PR and communications strategies, manage media
      relations and translate complex products into clear, consistent narratives across key global initiatives.
      This also includes creating messaging frameworks, guidelines and core communication materials. Previously,
      I worked for many years as a games and esports journalist and TV host for major German media outlets,
      including WDR, ARD and Deutschlandfunk. This editorial foundation continues to shape my structured,
      content-driven approach to communication.

    - |
      My strengths lie in planning, conceptual work and precise execution. I am looking for a role that values
      analytical thinking, editorial depth and an understanding of digital and interactive media. I would welcome
      the opportunity to discuss this further.

  closing: "Kind regards,"
