      I am writing to apply for the position of ==Beer Taster== at your wonderful company. 
      I have spent many years perfecting my sitting and watching things skills at the power plant, 
      and I feel I am ready for a new challenge that involves more snacks and fewer radiation suits. 
      Woo-hoo!

      In my current job as a Safety Inspector, I have successfully avoided hundreds of meltdowns by 
      simply staying awake for minutes at a time. I am very good at following instructions that 
      don't require more than three steps, and I have my own work attire (though it has some 
      mustard stains). I am also a former Grammy winner, so I bring a lot of class to the room. 
      Mmm... class.

      I hope you will consider me for this role. I am willing to work for donuts, Duff beer, or even 
      actual money. Please contact me soon before I get distracted by a moth or something shiny. 
      Everything's coming up Homer!

  closing: "Yours truly (I think),"
